This is the documentation repo for https://rcd.ucsb.edu/. For the code of this website, please visit https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/research-computing-data-code.

### Project Structure:

* Whatever you change in this github repo, it is just for the repo here. Whatever you change in the code in Pantheon, it is just for there only as well. The repo here is easier to access by public so we still keep this repo.
* DOCS contains the main directories and files in this repository about the whole system. You can start with DOCS/DEVS/00_GETTING_STARTED.md file and proceed in numerical order. 
* While the files in DOCS/PAGES are more specific about some specific pages such as community page, and there will be more details inside to guide you.
* After viewing all the documentations from DOCS, feel free to explore the rest of the repository.
