# Seeking Help

It is very normal that you encounter something difficult while working on the website. 

There are some help you can looking for:

- This repo! I would record / already recorded almost all the problems that I faced before and the solutions in this repo.

- UCSB Theme Documents: https://webtheme.brand.ucsb.edu/docs

- Google: Our fav friend no doubt : )

- GPT/Gemini: AI is our friend and it helped me several times during school. In addition, while using those large language models, please do not leak any importand/internal data. If you are not sure if you could use them for specific cases, ask your manager. Anyway, use them wisely!

- Senior-level people: It might take you a whole day to figure out something that a senior-level worker only need a few minutes. Don't be shy to ask when you are in need! They are all very smart and nice and helpful people!

    - Ryan Vizena: Senior Web Developer at UCSB. He has office hour usually at Wed 10am. (This schedule might change, you can google for more details.) Ryan really helps me a lot during my working time, especially at the web theme and coding problems. ryan.vizena@ucsb.edu 
 
    - Ian Lessing: Digital Library Development at UCSB. (not sure about his title but that's what I got from the library website) Ian also helped me a lot in the beginning, such as the SFTP connections. ilessing@library.ucsb.edu
 
    - Lucas Walker: Lucas helped a lot with our smooth transition from drupal 9 to drupal 10. If we need to changed to drupal 11 one day (which probably would), chat with Lucas for the details! lwwalker@ucsb.edu
