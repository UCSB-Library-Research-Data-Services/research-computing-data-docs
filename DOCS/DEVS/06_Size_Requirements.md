# Size Requirements for images

It is necessary to be consistent for the whole website, and image sizes are crucial, too. Normally, if we host the image in Drupal-embedded places, there is no need to worry about the sizes because Drupal will resize them automatically. However, if it is images on the places that we deal with like we write HTML, twig, CSS, or JavaScript to create that function, then we have a hard requirement for the image sizes, or it will mess it up. Here are the sizes for images:
