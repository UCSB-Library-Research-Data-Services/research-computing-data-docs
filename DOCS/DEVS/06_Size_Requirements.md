# Size Requirements for images

It is necessary to be consistent for the whole website, and images' sizes are crucial too. Normally, if we host the image in drupal embeded places, no need to worries about the sizes because drupal will resize them automatically. However, if it is images on the places that we diy with, like we write html, twig, css, javascript to create that function, then we have hard requirement for the image sizes, or it will mess it up. Here are the sizes for images:
