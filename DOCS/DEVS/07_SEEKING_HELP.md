# Seeking Help

You may encounter some technical difficulties or challenges while working on the website. 

Where to look for help:

- This repo! We have recorded some important documentation here.

- UCSB Theme Documents: https://webtheme.brand.ucsb.edu/docs

- Google: Our favorite friend, no doubt :)

- Campus support: It might take you a whole day to figure out something that a senior-level colleague only needs a few minutes. Don't be shy to ask when you are in need! They are all very smart, nice, and helpful people:

    - Ryan Vizena: Senior Web Developer at UCSB. He offers office hours https://www.campuscalendar.ucsb.edu/event/web_theme_open_office_hours or ryan.vizena@ucsb.edu (Drupal and Pantheon). Updates to the upstream. 
 
    - Ian Lessing: Digital Library Developer at UCSB. SFTP connections and Twig. ilessing@library.ucsb.edu
 
    - Lucas Walker: lwwalker@ucsb.edu
