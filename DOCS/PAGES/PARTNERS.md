# Editing the Partners Page.

## Add a new Partner:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> Partner
- Title is important for the Partner name (ie so you can search for it in case you need to edit it later), but it will not be displayed on the Partner page.
- Name: just be same as title
- Destionation: long description for the Partner.  
- URL: the website link of this Partner.
  
## Edit/Delete Partner:
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the filter, you can search for the title of the Partner you are looking for.  You should also use the 'Content Type' dropdown and change it to 'Partner'.  

## Edit Partner Page:  
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the Filter 'Content Type' dropdown, change it to 'Basic page'.  Then the title is 'Partners'  
- Alternatively, on the Partners page there is an Edit Button
- The other content is under Main Content, including the Partners View.


## Edit Partner Content Type / Node:
- Structure >> Content Types >> Partner

## Edit the Partners View:
- The view is the list of Partners.
- Structure >> Views >> Partners
- The view is mostly structured by custom templating and css.  The template file is under code/web/themes/ucsbwebrdhsub/templates/node--partner.html.twig and the css is under  code/web/themes/ucsbwebrdhsub/css.
- (btw, im still doing this two files, so there is no such node--partner.html.twig so far. will update later and delete this sentence : ))
