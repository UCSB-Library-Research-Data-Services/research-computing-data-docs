## Edit the Campus Units View:
- The view is the list of Campus Units.

- The view is mostly structured by custom templating and css.  The template file is under code/web/themes/ucsbwebrdhsub/templates/node--Campus Unit.html.twig and the css is under  code/web/themes/ucsbwebrdhsub/css.
- (btw, im still doing this two files, so there is no such node--Campus Unit.html.twig so far. will update later and delete this sentence : ))
- (it used to be called Partner, so if u found this word instead of campus unit, dont be surprise. Sorry for any inconvenience : ))
