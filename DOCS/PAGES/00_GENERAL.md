# General Rules for each page

### Each page has different content style, it would be convenient for content editor to learn about what is the content for each page. If it is a blade in drupal, you only need to go to pantheon (drupal) to work on it by clicking "edit." If it contains code, you will go to the code part and work on it. For more details of the code part, you can check documentations of that page in /PAGES.
