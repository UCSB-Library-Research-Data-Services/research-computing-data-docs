# Editing the Data Literacy Series Page.


## Add a new DLS Post:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> DLS Post
- Title: Enter Name of DLS Post
- Body: Enter brief description
- DLS Tags: Add any tags for your DLS Post.  If the tag exists, Drupal should display it with its id number in parantheses.  To add multiple tags, click "Add Another Item" button
- - If you want to add a tag to the DLS post, but there is no existing tag of the same name, you will have to create a new tag.  This is very easy and it is showed how to do so below.
- DLS MEDIA PDF: This is the main PDF that will have its thumbnail displayed.  Click Add Media -> Choose File Then after uploading your file, you should be able to select the thumbnail for the PDF you uploaded.
- DLS File: Upload the alternative PDF file if there is one.
- DLS Date: put the date for the DLS document.
- Notes: DLS Media PDF is for adding the PDF that will be displayed in the post's thumbnail.  It will ask you to add or select the PDF.  You will first need to add the PDF, then it will appear for you to be able to select it.  Then, the DLS File input is for the alternate PDF file if there is one.  
- Once the DLS Post is added, you will be redirected to the Drupal Node.  This is not navigatable by a user on the website, so you can ignore the formatting.  To view the new DLS Post, you can go to the DLS page.

## Edit/Delete DLS Post:
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the filter, you can search for the title of the DLS Post you are looking for.  You should also use the 'Content Type' dropdown and change it to 'DLS Post'.  

## Edit DLS Page:  
- The traditional Basic Page Edit for the DLS page is broken.  You must edit it this way:
- On the right hand side of the page, there is a gray Pencil icon.  If you do not see it, then go to the Drupal Tool Bar on the top, and click the "Edit" button on the far right of the toolbar.
- Click the pencil icon, then click "Quick Edit"
- Select where you want to edit.  For the DLS Page, you can edit the title and the starting text. 
- When you click the text of the page, there are two blades: the "Content" and the "View".  The view is the list of DLS posts that you have to edit a different way (below).
- Click on "Content" dropdown inside "Blades"
- Click the blue "Edit" button directly above it to edit it. 
- There will be 'columns' - drupal's way of organizing information even though there is only one column. Click the blue Edit button for the column.
- If you want to edit the HTML, click "Source"
- After making changes, make sure to save.

## Make a new Tag for a DLS post:  
- Go to Manage >> Structure >> Taxonomy >> DLS Vocabulary >> List Terms >> Add Term
- The Name field is the only field you have to do.  You can optionally add a description, but you shouldn't change anything else.

## Edit DLS View:
- Go to Manage >> Structure >> Views >> Data Literacy Series
- To edit the views requires a better understanding of drupal and html/css formatting.  There is more documentation under Devs/Getting_Started

## Edit Data Literacy Series Content Type / Node:
- Structure >> Content Types >> DLS Post
 
## URL problems in the thumbnail
- When clicking the thumbnail images, it will guide us to somewhere such as https://rcd.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2024-01/DLS-202401-Binder-navy.pdf.
- If the url doesn't start with https://rcd.ucsb.edu/sites, rebuild the site's cache and force the setting of any new database queries.
- If it doesn't work, then try see if any aggregation is turned on/off and re-configure that, especially if the module or theme uses a lot of javascript calls.
- If that still not working, it could be due to the module's code not properly redirecting the links once the page is saved.
