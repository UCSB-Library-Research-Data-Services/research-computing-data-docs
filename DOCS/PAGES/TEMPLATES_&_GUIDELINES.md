# Editing the Templates & Guidelines Page.

### This page is designed to be similar to the Data Literacy Series page. 

## Add a new T&G Post:
- Go to Manage >> Content >> Add Content >> T&G Post
- Title: Enter Name of T&G Post
- Body: Enter brief description
- T&G Tags: Add any tags for your T&G Post.  If the tag exists, Drupal should display it with its id number in parantheses.  To add multiple tags, click "Add Another Item" button
- If you want to add a tag to the T&G post, but there is no existing tag of the same name, you will have to create a new tag.  This is very easy and it is showed how to do so below.

## Edit/Delete T&G Post:
- Go to Manage >> Content
- In the filter, you can search for the title of the DLS Post you are looking for.  You should also use the 'Content Type' dropdown and change it to 'T&G Post'.  

## Edit T&G Page:  
- Go to Manage >> Content, find this page and click Edit on right side. 
- When you click the text of the page, there are two blades: the "Content" and the "View".  The view is the list of DLS posts that you have to edit a different way (below).
- Click on "Content" dropdown inside "Blades"
- Click the blue "Edit" button directly above it to edit it. 
- There will be 'columns' - drupal's way of organizing information even though there is only one column. Click the blue Edit button for the column.
- If you want to edit the HTML, click "Source"
- After making changes, make sure to save.

## Make a new Tag for a T&G post:  
- Go to Manage >> Structure >> Taxonomy >> T&G Vocabulary >> List Terms >> Add Term
- The Name field is the only field you have to do.  You can optionally add a description, but you shouldn't change anything else.

## Edit T&G View:
- Go to Manage >> Structure >> Views >> Templates & Guidelines
- To edit the views requires a better understanding of drupal and html/css formatting.  There is more documentation under Devs/Getting_Started

## Edit Templates & Guidelines Content Type / Node:
- Structure >> Content Types >> T&G Item
